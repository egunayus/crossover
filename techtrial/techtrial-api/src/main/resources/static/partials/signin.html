<!-- Define controller for body. In this example we use only one controller for the scope of entire body. --><!-- Place a span that is going to act as a container for button rendering through script code. -->
        <span id="googleSignIn">
            <span id="signInButton">test button here
            </span>
        </span>
 
        <!-- Don't forget to place the script that does the asynchronous loading of Google+ JavaScript API.
             Because it is loaded asynchronously, it might take some time to load. 
             Place some loading notification, so user won't get confused. 
             You can use ng-show and ng-hide to show or hide your notification and accomplish best user experience. -->
